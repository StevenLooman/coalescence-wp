Coalescence
===========

Coalescence for Wordpress is a theme which allows you to load any HTML theme and directly use that in your own Wordpress site. It does so by loading the HTML theme and replace any part of it with your own content.

Why?
----

When I first got in touch with [Diazo](http://www.diazo.org), through [Plone](https://plone.org/), I was impressed. Although it can be hard to use, the idea is very usable.

I wanted to use the idea and apply it to Wordpress. Hence, Coalescence was born.

After a while though, after using it for several sites, I lost interest in the project. Hence, I am now releasing it for free.
